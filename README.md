## Usage
 When the user opens the website they are presented with a calendar that displays every hour of the day.

 The grey boxes indicate the time has already passed in the day, the red box indicates the current time and the green box indicates the future hours of the day.

 When the user clicks on a specific hour in the schedule they can enter information in about that hour. The user can then save the data by pressing the save button. 

 The saved data is then saved to local storage. The user can refresh the webpage and their data events will persist.
